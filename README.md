# Stuffs
I have no clue how to use github so if my stuff seems shitty that's because it is.
My Python projects are in here
Many of the commits are under the name ryanmiller07 because I'm using a public computer so he's still signed in I think. I don't really know why their under his name even though I'm logged into github
